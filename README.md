# OpenCV-for-Scene-Boundary-Shot-Detection-
This repository Shows a simple way to detect the scenes from a video and save it on your disk as a PNG file

My friend recently put up a story on his whatsapp where Novack Djokovic was eating grass after winning the Wimbeldon Finals. I wanted to Capture Some of his expressions but without sreenshots. 
I Thought is it possible everytime I pause the story via my thumb and record the whole process and later provide that recorded video as the input to the above program. 
so that the pauses are automatically detected and I get the images as the output . 

The code is referrenced from PyImageSearch blog of Scene-Detection . 


The Repository Conatins Detect_Scene_from_video.py file where the main code is written. 
When You are done executing the file , the output will be placed in Djokovic Folder .
